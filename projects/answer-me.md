# Background
Learning new things is what people always looking for. With the pervasiveness of internet, people now have the access to abundant information. The most efficent way for people to learn is absorbing information they can understand or relate to. For example, an Asian girl would like to know how it's like to live in New York City. The best answer for her would be the one given by other Asian people, since they all share a common culture and experience. Likewise, a student interested in learning new programming skills would learn faster when reading notes from his peers with similar background than that from a teacher's perspective.

Google is good at answering fact or knowledge, but it fails to deliver personalized content about subjective experience when we're looking for answers to the questions addressed above. This is the motivation why we'd like to initiate this project.

# Idea
- Build a platform allowing people to share their personal experience.
- Design a corresponding mechanism to help readers find the content they care about.

# Challenge
- How to encourage users to contibute experience? Platforms like Quora or Zhihu allow users to use text to answer the question, but this might frighten a lot of people who do have some ideas about the question but don't want to spend so much time on it. Is it a lighter way to collect people's opionion or experience on a question?
- How could we better understand the users so that we could provide the right information they're looking for?
