Your Startup Project
--------------------

### Introduction

Students collaborate on an ambitious software project, a technology startup, from start to finish during the semester.

### Submitting Deliverables

The following schedule lists a few intermediate deliverables.  Add them to your project page and submit a pull request before Friday the week they are due.  Each deliverable is worth 1 point towards your final grade.

Your First Story and MVP proposals should be added as content directly on the project page, and you should include a link to your First Story demo and your Investor Pitch presentation and demo.


### Important Dates

#### 26-Aug: Introduction to Building Your Startup

Students hear an introduction to building startup technology and have a week to think about a project, either pick one from [existing projects](/README.md) or suggest their own. The criteria for new projects is that it must address a *broad market* and have potential for a very small *minimal viable product* that can be built in a few weeks.

#### 02-Sep: Deadline and Elevator Pitch for New Project Ideas

If you have another project idea, contribute the project description to this repository, see [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Either way, you must prepare a 30 second elevator pitch for the project in front of the class. If your project is new, you will get to pitch it. If it's not, a lottery will decide whether you pitch it.

#### 09-Sep: Deadline for Groups Being Formed

Students can do a project individually or in groups. Each group must have a maximum of 3 students. Each student's name appears next to a project.

Students demonstrate a working product that implements the first story in front of class and propose some ideas of what an MVP for the product could look like.
