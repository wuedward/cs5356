 Material sourcing platform for industries 
-----------------------

### Background
The process of purchasing raw materials for any manufacturing industry is complex. There are a number of middlemen involved who act as suppliers and suitable candidates are 
usually discovered through personal connections, newspaper advertisements etc. These mediums have little reach because of which industries and suppliers both miss out on opportunities. Also, there is little transparency and visibility to the trade which is happening in the outside world. Our product idea aims to facilitate trade, make it easier, simpler and cheaper.  

### Challenge
We aim to create an online platform where all the players involved in trade, like industries, suppliers, contractors etc can connect and partner with each other. Through a profile page/dashboard, the entities will also be able to display the materials they can supply/manufacture (like alumina, pig iron, coal etc), their past and current trading histories, their current activites etc. Industries will be able to discover new sources based on their requirements like materials, location and quality. Through this platform we also envision to make activites like bulk purchases, negotiations, auctions simpler.
