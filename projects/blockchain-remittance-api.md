Block Chain Based Remittance API
---------------------------------

### Background

Build an API for a block chain based system of sending remittances.

### Challenge

While technology gives consumers new ways to spend money, sending money from one bank to another is still not
a simple process. This is especially true if the banks are located in a different country. This solution would
allow banks to let their users take advantage of the convenience provided by technology and the security provided 
by a block chain. 

### Summary

- A bank uses our API to have a secure, and easy traceable channel to instantly transfer money to another bank regardless of location.

- A user can choose our service from a multitude of banks (instead of a wire transfer) to cheaply, quickly, and securely send money to anyone, anywhere.

### Further Ideas 

Creating a standalone application independent of any bank is also another way of solving this problem. However
there is an issue of how to actually handle how money is sent abroad. Bitcoin is also another possible addition.
